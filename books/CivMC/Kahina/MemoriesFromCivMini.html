It began as an ordinary day, no different from any that came before.

I was harvesting the vast sugar cane fields of my homeland, Heikki, when word arrived from the messengers above:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 28</a><div class="page-content">a new world had been discovered.

The news spread swiftly among many nations, prompting several to begin assembling task forces to investigate this unfamiliar land.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 28</a><div class="page-content">My own nation prepared nothing official, yet my sense of adventure pushed me to seek a group willing to explore this foreign realm.

While visiting the nation of XiaoHongShu, I heard one of its residents, hxrper, speak of a task force composed mostly</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 28</a><div class="page-content">of Kallosians and Volterrans. Intrigued by the prospect of joining such an experienced team, I asked to be included, and was accepted.

Our group was first known as the Garden, later taking the name LOTUS, under the leadership of dredd_kiji and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Troll_bebek.

We made initial preparations and set goals for settling on this land.

Our primary objective was to locate a portal and build a base of operations around it, as early access to the Nether would provide crucial</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 28</a><div class="page-content">advantage.

When launch day arrived, excitement surged through the intermediary world, known as "pvp".

Several task forces and lone explorers awaited their chance to step into this new realm.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 28</a><div class="page-content">One by one, they departed, until at last, my turn came. I remember materializing in a quiet spruce forest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 28</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>2. The First Hour</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

My first action was to bury my spawn book. Every newfriend receives one upon arrival, and my petty desire to keep mine out of others' hands left me no choice but to hide it away.

Afterward, I set out to craft basic tools</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 28</a><div class="page-content">, knowing how dangerous a world this primitive could be.

In my homeland, the rule of law keeps most acts of crime in check, for nations are strong enough to enforce their rules.

But in a world so young and untamed, no such order exists.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Only the cunning make it through the first day unscathed.

Shortly after acquiring my basic gear, I spotted another player. He appeared to be AFK, so I decided to kill him as food was scarce in this newborn world, and survival left little</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 28</a><div class="page-content">room for mercy.

With the extra supplies in hand, I was able to explore a wider area. The simplest method to locate a portal was to use player essence, a resource granted once per day after thirty minutes of playtime.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 28</a><div class="page-content">As soon as we began receiving our essence, we used it to track portals.

My memory of the terrain is hazy, but I recall following a portal trail until I encountered a large group of players led by Hitmehn and Gregy165.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Outnumbered and outmatched, I fled immediately without engagin; I had no illusion of driving them out of there alone.

Fortunately, one of the LOTUS members discovered an untouched portal in a cold region to the northeast. I called this place Lammoth.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Since no other groups had claimed it, we used our otts to converge on its location and began constructing a bunker around it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 28</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>3. The Base</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

Our task force numbered more than 10 that day, giving us alot of manpower.

As more members arrived at the base, we quickly moved into resource gathering operations.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 28</a><div class="page-content">We had to be careful with Nether entry, as its early game achievements granted experience at a time when no cauldrons existed, making any advantage hard to conceal.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Hours passed as our mining teams returned with valuable resources, like iron, gold and diamonds, which we would desperately need later.

Gold proved especially important, as it allowed us to craft high level enchanted</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 28</a><div class="page-content">tools and armor at a very low cost.

Meanwhile, some of our members began scouting rival groups and, in a few cases, even raiding them, resulting in some pearls.

These actions drew unwanted attention and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 28</a><div class="page-content">incited retaliation; an enemy incursion began after a small detachtment of our own was killed in their territory.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 28</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>4. The Attack</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

As we knew what was coming to us, we started to prepare for a fight.

But very soon we realized the equipment used by our enemies from Biscuitville was fairly superior to ours, combined with potions and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 28</a><div class="page-content">enchanted golden swords.

I wasn't at the base when the attack began; I had been tending our wheat farm to produce a good food supply.

When the alarm was raised, I chose not to return to the base.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 28</a><div class="page-content">It was obvious we would be overpowered very quickly, and rushing back would only add another casualty to the inevitable.

As soon as the assault began, the enemy forced their way into our bunker, leaving us with little time to respond.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Limpopo and Florsica wiped the floor with us, despite _benzodiazepine's attempt to cart bomb them. Maxtriii and i_rs also fell during the battle.

When all seemed lost and morale was at its lowest, something unexpected happened.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Roughly an hour after the battle, our attackers released the captured members of our group.

Even more surprising, the base had suffered minimal griefing.

This mercy gave us a second chance.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 28</a><div class="page-content">With a more low profile approach, we started to rebuild in the next day.

Despite everything, it seemed the garden would blossom.</div></div>

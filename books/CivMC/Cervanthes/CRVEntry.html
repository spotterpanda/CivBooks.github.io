This is a collection of Poems i've written IRL over the past years.

They were mostly written during my time in Afghanistan, Sudan, Mali and volunteer service in eastern europe.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 34</a><div class="page-content">None of these are particulary good or anything but were dumped into my small little paper notebook at that time. they are in no real order nor context to each other.
Questions regarding time, date, location or context to the individual poems will be ignored   Enjoy!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 34</a><div class="page-content">TheDoor
I opened the door, and time stood still, A child's face framed by the cold and the chill. Eyeswide with fear, or courage, or both, A trembling hand breaking my oath

The gun it raised was too heavy to bear, yet in its shadow, I gasped for Air.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 34</a><div class="page-content">A heartbeat passed  a choice, a command, the weight of death in a tiny hand.

and then

The silence fell, loud as a scream, Shattering hope, unravelling the dream. i knelt in the dust, my soul torn apart. A childs shadow etched</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 34</a><div class="page-content">into my heart.

I whisper now, in the ashes and pain, farewell, young soul, lost to the flame. Myou find peace where i cannot tread, In a world untouched by the blood we've shed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Windows to the barricade

I hold my pen like a rifle tight. tight, A soldier still fighting, though out of sight. The ink bleeds truths i dare not share, but in these lines, i lay them bare.

Each verse a viewport into my mind</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 34</a><div class="page-content">A window to demons ive left confined. Locked behind a soldier's steel Yet here in ink i let them feel.

The scream of mortar the thunder of guns Echo in stanzas where silence runs. I write of comrades who never returned, and battles foiught though no flags burned</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 34</a><div class="page-content">My poems a valve for sorrows tide, An outlet for wounds i cannot hide. They see things i wont allow, the scars i carry the oaths i vow. 

But will they grasp this fractured frame?
This burden borne in dutys name?
Or will they see just words on a page?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 34</a><div class="page-content">A soldiers grief, a poets cage?

For now i write though words may fail to paint the depths of this fragile veil
These lines are my gift my curse my plea A fleeting glimpse of the war in me</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Good or Evil

Am I the hammer or am I the nail?
The questions haunt, the answers pale.
I swore an oath, my loyalty clear,
Yet doubt creeps close, a shadow near.

Is this what it means to serve the right? to snuff out lives</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 34</a><div class="page-content">in the name of might?
What victory blooms from the seeds I sow?
What justice comes from the blood that flows?

I see the faces, the lives I’ve stilled,
Each one a story that I’ve unfilled.
They haunt my dreams, they call my name,
Their echoes branding</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 34</a><div class="page-content">my soul with their name.

When I stand one day at the pearly gate,
And face the weight of my chosen fate,
What will I say when the ledger is read,
When my deeds rise up from the countless dead?

Will the answer come</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 34</a><div class="page-content"> in a voice so pure,
Or silence fall, vast and unsure?
Is the path I walk ordained by grace,
Or just the scars of a world misplaced?

Beneath the moon, beneath the sky,
I march with doubt, I march and cry.
For a soldiers burden is not the fight</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 34</a><div class="page-content">but the endless question is this right?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 34</a><div class="page-content">The Question
When my boots tread the ashen ground,
And silence wraps the world around,
Will the Devil rise, his hand outstretched,
Or recoil from the soul he etched?

Will Death, that thief with hollow stare,
Greet me like one beyond repair?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Or will he falter, scythe in hand,
Before the ruin I command?

For I am their craft, their grim design,
A weapon forged in fire and time.
Each drop of blood, each whispered wail,
A testament to how they fail.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Am I their kin, their chosen son,
The proof of battles never won?
Or am I wrath they can’t contain,
The shadow born of their disdain?

Devil, Death—do you not see,
The monster you have made of me?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 34</a><div class="page-content">And when I come to claim my place,
Will fear or pride distort your face?

I am your heir, your legacy,
The war you waged through men like me.
So answer now, and make it true
Did i create hell, or did hell create you?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 34</a><div class="page-content">A passage of time:
Another year 366 days, a cycle complete,
Each second carved, each moment bittersweet.
More than half spent on foreign soil, unknown,
Defending lands that will never be home.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Tik tok, the clock takes its toll 45…
How long must I keep this burden alive?
I’ve wandered to places I’d never dreamed,
Seen horrors that cut and joy that beamed.
Done deeds I’d wish no one to repeat,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 34</a><div class="page-content">In darkness, where guilt and shadows meet.
But even in sorrow, a flicker remains,
The light persists, though fleeting and faint.

Tik tok, another step 46…</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Thirteen nations, thirteen lands,
Cultures of life, of fate’s cruel hands.
Some I embraced, their stories I knew,
Others destroyed, their hopes subdued.
Deserts, jungles, ruins of stone,
Worlds erased, to none their own.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 34</a><div class="page-content">To some, we came as salvation’s grace,
A lifeline to flee this forsaken place.
To others, we bore the ferryman’s grin,
Guiding their souls for my life’s sin.

Tik tok, the hours pass 47…</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Two hundred seventy lives—or was it more?
The tally’s blurred, the memories sore.
Each breath ceased, each cry cut short,
Their faces haunt my nightly court.
Perhaps it’s 300, or even 400 now,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 34</a><div class="page-content">A toll unseen, yet heavy somehow.
The ferryman smiles; I pay my due,
My wandering life, the devil’s skew.

Tik tok, the minutes fade 48… 49… 50…</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Five brothers gone, their debts now mine,
Two especially etched, their absence defined.
Michael… Artur… we laughed, we played,
Then mourned in silence where laughter decayed.
Would it have been me? The thought won’t stay,
For nothing would alter the chosen way.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 34</a><div class="page-content">We were one, a perfect whole,
In life, in loss, in shared soul.

Tik tok, 51… 52… 53…</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 34</a><div class="page-content">I miss you both in ways words betray,
But promise me, brothers, to light my way.
From your watch above, keep your gaze,
Until we reunite in endless days.

Tik tok, 54…</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 34</a><div class="page-content">The faces scream, the voices cry,
The payment due cannot deny.
The ferryman waits with greedy grin,
For the year’s harvest, my soul within.
But I let them rise, give them their voice,
A moment to mourn, their fleeting choice.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Tik tok, 55…

I close my eyes—“Come forth, scream loud!
Shatter my walls, break through the shroud!”
Five minutes, I yield, I open the gate,
For the dead to howl, for ghosts to sate.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 34</a><div class="page-content">They ravage my mind, take their toll,
Their departure carves a jagged hole.

Tik tok, 56… 57… 58… 59…
Midnight tolls, the world spins anew,
A year begins, the ledger too.
I rebuild my walls, brick by brick</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Each one heavy, my mind grows thick.

How many more? I cannot say,
But I’ll carry the weight for another day.
For this is my pact, my burden to bear,
The cost of the life I choose to wear.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Tik tok, the clock resumes its rhyme,
A soldier’s soul, one step at a time.



This shall be all for this one. fitting these into a minecraft book made me realise my "poems" are way too fcking long but eh
I hope whoever read</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 34</a><div class="page-content">these had at least some positive thoughts about em.

I appreciate you whoever clicked so far into this.</div></div>
